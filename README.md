# TODO: a title for your project

The following game is played by two players.

Consider a chess table with a white and a black knight placed on it. The pieces are placed on the squares a8 and h1 initially. One player moves the white knight, the other one the black knight, they move their piece in turn. The knights can move according to the rules of the chess with the following restriction: a piece can be moved to a square only if none of the pieces were on it before. The player who can make the last move wins the game.

When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.

The program must store the result of the games as follows. For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started, the name of the players, the number of moves made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner. The program should be able to display a high score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed.
